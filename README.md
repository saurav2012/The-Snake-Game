# The-Snake-Game
We all are familiar with the "Snake Game" of Nokia mobiles. The game is interesting as well as challenging for us in childhood. Today while learning Front end development I have made my first ever coding project "Snake 1.0".

In this project you have to eat foods appearing in different color of small boxes. After eating each box you will gain 1 point and by doing so you can score maximum points from your team-mate. The game is easy to understand it has one simple rule that you have to follow - You don't touch boundary/walls of the box, if does you will be out and game is over. Your score is present at top right above the cell/box. In the end i would like to thanks Coding Blocks Pvt. Ltd.(Youtube) with the help of whom I am able to complete this first project.
