# The-Snake-Game
We all are familiar with the "Snake Game" of Nokia mobiles. The game is interesting as well as challenging for us in childhood. Today while learning Front end development I have made my first ever coding project "Snake 1.0".

In this project/game you have to eat foods appearing in different color of small boxes. After eating each box you will gain 1 point and by doing so you can score maximum points from your team-mate. Whenever you eat one food your length will increase by one. The game is easy to understand it has one simple rule that you have to follow - You can't touch boundary/walls of the box, by doing so you will be out and game is over. Your score is present at top right above the cell/box. In the end i would like to thanks Coding Blocks Pvt. Ltd.(Youtube) with the help of whom i am able to complete my first project.
